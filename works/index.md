####[Save Ukraine *(iOS, Android)*](/works/save_ukraine.html)

[ ![ ]({{ site.JB.work_prev_path }}/SaveUkrainePreview.png) ](/works/save_ukraine.html)

Your goal is to defend the cozy Ukrainian house (or "khata" in ukrainian) from the invasion of unidentified green angry
soldiers. As it happens the only weapon you have is a crop of fresh ripe pumpkins. Nevertheless in good hands this could
be a very effective measure against the attackers - a precise shot can neutralize one or many bastards or even one armed SUV.
Find the best tactic that suits you and with time you could make 100 000 points to win the game !

A little bear named Bobby has a dream. He wants to cook a fruit soup. Help the little bear to have a bite and to
collect all ingredients for the fruit soup. Use the elements of the environment to achieve your goal. Be careful
and do not eat the chilli peppers – they are very hot. Watch the fruits attentively, otherwise they can be eaten
by hungry pigs. Collect the stars to earn more points. Good luck!

What happens when composers fall asleep? They conduct Dream Symphonies.
In this dreamlike adventure game, you need to make the most of your trampoline prowess. Bounce off the back
of sheep to hit perfect pitch…and collect musical notes along your journey. Get a boost from the floating bubbles,
but beware of dangerous red bubbles, which can wake you up. Perfect your aim, because
there’s no way back down: the only way is up.
