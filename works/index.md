The game is called Save Ukraine and the story of the game is very topical. Unidentified horde of armed green men
suddenly attacked a cozy Ukrainian house (or “khata” in local). The inhabitants were not ready for such events and
the only weapon to defend their homeland they had was just a crop of old pumpkins. Nevertheless, a good and precise
hit of such “shell” can neutralize few of those green bastards or even an armored truck.

A little bear named Bobby has a dream. He wants to cook a fruit soup. Help the little bear to have a bite and to
collect all ingredients for the fruit soup. Use the elements of the environment to achieve your goal. Be careful
and do not eat the chilli peppers – they are very hot. Watch the fruits attentively, otherwise they can be eaten
by hungry pigs. Collect the stars to earn more points. Good luck!

What happens when composers fall asleep? They conduct Dream Symphonies.
In this dreamlike adventure game, you need to make the most of your trampoline prowess. Bounce off the back
of sheep to hit perfect pitch…and collect musical notes along your journey. Get a boost from the floating bubbles,
but beware of dangerous red bubbles, which can wake you up. Perfect your aim, because
there’s no way back down: the only way is up.
