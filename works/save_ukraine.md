Your goal is to defend the cozy Ukrainian house (or "khata" in ukrainian) from the invasion of unidentified green angry
soldiers. As it happens the only weapon you have is a crop of fresh ripe pumpkins. Nevertheless in good hands this could
be a very effective measure against the attackers - a precise shot can neutralize one or many bastards or even one armed SUV.
Find the best tactic that suits you and with time you could make 100 000 points to win the game !
