The game is called Save Ukraine and the story of the game is very topical. Unidentified horde of armed green
men suddenly attacked a cozy Ukrainian house (or “khata” in local). The inhabitants were not ready for such events
and the only weapon to defend their homeland they had was just a crop of old pumpkins. Nevertheless, a good and precise
hit of such “shell” can neutralize few of those green bastards or even an armored truck.
